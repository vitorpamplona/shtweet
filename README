This is a short shell script to use twitter from command line. Probably the simplest twitter client ever made. 

We use cookie-based authentication (just like a browser) instead of the annoying oAuth. 

--------

Install: 
> chmod 777 twitter.sh

Usage:

- Login
> ./twitter.sh login <user> <passwd>

- See your timeline
> ./twitter.sh see

- Post a message. 
> ./twitter.sh say <whateveryouwannatell>

Simple isn't it? And the code is also pretty simple, check it out:
